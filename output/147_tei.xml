            <p>Historical demography in and about Southeastern Europe is still less developed compared to the leading centers of this research, which are mainly located in Northwestern Europe. Historical surveys of this region often deal with this topic only very marginally; there is also no publication yet that deals exclusively with this topic in Southeastern Europe during the last two centuries - there are only publications on the population history or historical demography of a single country or of Europe as a whole. The studies available so far on regional differences in the historical demography of a country or between individual occupational groups concern the only database of representative rural and urban populations in Southeastern Europe: Albania based on the 1918 census. This project will allow similar studies in other countries of this region and comparative studies between these countries. For this purpose, samples of all other countries in Southeastern Europe will be created, including urban populations on a large scale.</p>
            <p>The following research questions will be answered: What regional differences in fertility and nuptiality existed in historical Southeastern Europe? What regional differences existed in historical household structures and cohabitation within a household in Southeastern Europe? What regional differences existed in terms of family patriarchal structures? What differences do individual occupational groups show in terms of marriage patterns and household formation and fertility? Which influencing factors were mainly responsible for these differences?</p>
            <p>In a first step, archives in the countries of Southeastern Europe will be searched for existing manuscripts of censuses up to World War 1. From these, a selection will then be made that is as representative as possible in order to study urban and rural families and different regions within each country. The selected individuals and families are then entered into a database and coded based on key characteristics (gender, marital status, relationship, occupation, religion).</p>
            <p>The microdata will be coded based on existing coding systems (IPUMS, NAPP, Mosaic, HISCO), thus ensuring that the new data will subsequently be comparable to existing data. Analyses will be based on the child-woman ratio, the Singulate Mean Age at Marriage (SMAM), the proportion remaining unmarried, the age gap between spouses, the patriarchy index and measures of cohabitation (dyadic relationships - who lives with whom?).</p>
            <p>This project will create the largest European database of historical census data outside the already established centers of historical-demographic research. Studies based on this large-scale expanded database will shed light on previously obscure areas of Southeastern Europe with respect to historical demography, household structures, and family patriarchy. The new data will be made available to the international research community free of charge (open access) and this should create additional opportunities for research, including research questions that are not part of historical demography. Collaboration in research should be encouraged, and the gap between state-level analyses and village studies should be bridged by regional-level analyses.</p>

         <head>Serbia 1863: 93,577 persons, 21,343 households</head>
         <p>The manuscripts of the 1863 population census of Serbia are located in the Serbian State Archives (Arhiv Srbije) in Belgrade. This data of the first part of this sample was provided after an official request was made by Prof. Joel M. Halpern to the archive and provided to him directly by archive personnel. No restrictions were made. In the 1960s digitization was carried out under grants made to Joel M. Halpern at the University of Massachusetts, Department of Anthropology, with funding from the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health), and research grants from the University of Massachusetts. Subsequent work was done during the 1990s and 2000s at the University of Graz, Austria, beginning in 1993 with funding from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF). Detailed information is available in the Joel Martin Halpern collection from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst/Special collections &amp; University archives. The major part of the sample was transcribed, coded, and harmonized as part of the research project “Demography and social structures in historical Southeast Europe” (P 38285-G, 2021-2025, funded by FWF).</p>
         <note>The city of Kruševac contains 102 servants who live alone and have no property at all. They were enumerated as separate units in the census, because they had an income, but they were obviously not forming independent households. Therefore they are coded as servants and not household heads and their households as incomplete households. The census does not have information about the place where they served. 45 servants have either co-residing relatives or property of their own, therefore they are treated as independent households.</note>

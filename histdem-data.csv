Beschreibung,Detaillierte Beschreibung des Datensatzes,"The manuscripts of the 1863 population census of Serbia are located in the Serbian State Archives (Arhiv Srbije) in Belgrade. This data of the first part of this sample was provided after an official request was made by Prof. Joel M. Halpern to the archive and provided to him directly by archive personnel. No restrictions were made. In the 1960s digitization was carried out under grants made to Joel M. Halpern at the University of Massachusetts, Department of Anthropology, with funding from the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Mental Health), and research grants from the University of Massachusetts. Subsequent work was done during the 1990s and 2000s at the University of Graz, Austria, beginning in 1993 with funding from the Austrian Science Fund (FWF). Detailed information is available in the Joel Martin Halpern collection from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst/Special collections & University archives. The major part of the sample was transcribed, coded, and harmonized as part of the research project “Demography and social structures in historical Southeast Europe” (P 38285-G, 2021-2025, funded by FWF).","The census of 1918 resulted from the occupation of the majority of the territory of the newly created independent Albanian state (except parts in the south and southeast) by the Austro-Hungarian army in 1916. Officers of the Austro-Hungarian army collected the census data with the assistance of Albanian officers from March to July 1918. Most of the manuscripts have been saved from destruction and are now stored in the archive of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The research project, ""The 1918 Albanian Population Census: Data Entry and Basic Analyses,"" based at the University of Graz and funded by the Austrian Science Fund (2000-2003), sought to convert the data into machine-readable form. Up to now, the data of 285 villages and six cities have been entered in a database. The data consists of two samples: -100% -sample of the urban population; villages containing Orthodox Christians and ethnic minorities; villages being characterized by an uneven sex-ratio or very large or very small households -10% -sample of all other villages","The 1879 population census data of Montenegro was provided as part of the research project 'Demography and Society in Historical Southeastern Europe' (principle investigator: Mag. Dr. Siegfried Gruber) at the Institute of History, University of Graz, Mozartgasse 3, 8010 Graz, Austria, and funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF, project no. P 34285-G). An official request was made by Mag. Dr. Siegfried Gruber to Srđan Pejović, who agreed to provide a transcription of the Montenegrin Census of 1879 in a MS Word file. The transcription has been turned into a database and coded according to the Mosaic standard in Graz, Austria, by Mag. Dr. Siegfried Gruber and Daniel-Armin Đumić, MA. This cooperation was adopted and approved by the State Archive of Montenegro in 2020 while the above research project was still in the planning phase. No restrictions were imposed.","This dataset covers 23,748 Apostolic Armenian males and females who were permanent residents (referred to as yerliler and տեղացիներ) of the province of Istanbul. Persons residing in these households, but not being a member of the Apostolic Armenian Church, are not included in this data file. The population register it is based on was compiled around the year 1907 as part of an empire-wide census. It was written in Armenian and Armeno-Turkish (i.e., Ottoman Turkish written with Armenian letters). The location of the original register is unclear, but a microfilmed copy is available at the Krikor and Clara Zohrab Information Center in New York City (microfilm collection items 1213461, 1213462, and 1213463). The data was transcribed and coded as part of a research project called ""Recovering Armenians in Late Ottoman Istanbul and Making Ottoman-Era Population Data Available for All"", which was funded by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and hosted at Istanbul Bilgi University. The full register contains information about 40,000 individuals, of which about 60 % are included in this data file. The data is available for download at this site: https://www.houshamadyan.org/mapottomanempire/vilayet-of-istanbul/istanbul/locale/demography.html","This is a sample of eight villages of the Bulgarian side of the Rhodope mountains, covering the time period of 1877 to 1947. The sample contains Orthodox Bulgarians and Bulgarian-speaking Muslims (Pomaks). The three samples of Čepelare in the 20th century do not contain the whole population, but about 100 households each. This data file was transcribed by Ulf Brunnbauer and additional information about this data is available in the following publications: Ulf Brunnbauer, Families and mountains in the Balkans: Christian and Muslim household structures in the Rhodopes, 19th-20th century. In: The History of the Family 7 (2002) 327-350.  Ulf Brunnbauer, Gebirgsgesellschaften auf dem Balkan: Wirtschaft und Familienstrukturen im Rhodopengebirge (19./20. Jahrhundert). Zur Kunde Südosteuropas II/34. Wien, Köln, Weimar: 2004.","This is a sample of the Wallachian census of 1838 and covers the southern part of present-day Romania. It is a representative sample of the rural population and was created by Bogdan Mateescu for the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. The sampling is based on four regional strata (east, north, south and south-west). Weighting cannot be applied, because the census manuscripts have not been preserved completely and therefore the population figures are not known. More information about this census is available in a Mosaic Working Paper.","These are soul listings (status animarum) for two Roman Catholic parishes near Dubrovnik (Croatia) in the year 1674. The archival material can be found in the Historijski arhiv Dubrovnik, call number Acta S. Mariae Maioris, saec. XVII. No. 1809/4 and 21.","The 1885 (1300 h.) and 1907 (1322 h.) censuses were the first Empire-wide censuses undertaken for purposes other than either taxation or military conscription. They are the first ones to include information about women. The 1907 census is overall the more reliable of the two. The samples cover 5 percent only of the permanent Muslim population of 5 central districts of Istanbul, only a small percentage of whose occupations were recorded, and over-represent those with non-manual occupations. For more information see: Alan Duben and Cem Behar (1991) Istanbul households: Marriage, family and fertility, 1880-1940 (Cambridge Studies in Population, Economy and Society in Past Time 15). Cambridge University Press.","The 1885 (1300 h.) and 1907 (1322 h.) censuses were the first Empire-wide censuses undertaken for purposes other than either taxation or military conscription.

The data covers the rural population of present-day Hungary, Slovakia, and partly Romania (Transylvania). Survival of the 1869 census material is very unevenly distributed within this territory and therefore the sampling is based on 9 regions. The data is rather similar to the size of the different regions. The household weight variable produces results according to the real rural population in the 9 regions. The second variable used for sampling is religion (ethnicity or language was not included in the census). The data also reflects the religious denominations rather well, but there has been no surviving census material for Orthodox Christians in the Partium region and for German Lutherans in Transylvania. The person weight variable produces an output which reflects the religious composition of the whole sampled area within the Kingdom of Hungary, but not the religious composition within the 9 regions."
Anmerkungen,Weitere Anmerkungen zum Datensatz,"The city of Kruševac contains 102 servants who live alone and have no property at all. They were enumerated as separate units in the census, because they had an income, but they were obviously not forming independent households. Therefore they are coded as servants and not household heads and their households as incomplete households. The census does not have information about the place where they served. 45 servants have either co-residing relatives or property of their own, therefore they are treated as independent households.","The data has to be weighted to represent the population of the prefectures, which have been used as sampling strata. The variable hhwt does not account for religion, because this variable has not been used in the sampling process and is based on the published population. The variable perwt does account for religion and is based on the enumerated population. Further information can be found at the website https://albanischevolkszaehlung.uni-graz.at/","The last 150 pages of Book 1 of the census have the symbol ""-II-"" instead of the last names of all household members except the heads, and in some cases, their spouses. Determining the correct related variable is a significantly difficult task.","For research that uses and discusses this data, see Daniel Ohanian, ""Collaboration in Ottoman Governance: The c. 1907 Imperial Census and the Armenian Apostolic Patriarchate of Istanbul,"" Journal of the Ottoman and Turkish Studies Association 4, no. 2 (2017): 365–380; and Daniel Ohanian, ""The 1902 (AH 1320, AR 1318) Ottoman Census Regulations,"" Academia.edu, www.academia.edu/34414609/.

Therefore some “children” are reported to have occupations other than being servants.","There are no names given, and terms for certain relationships included in these data files and ages are not always reliable.
